# IZU Fundamentals of Artificial Intelligence
Project from Fundamentals of Artificial Intelligence university course (2021-2022 academic year)

## Project 1: Minimax algorithm plus Alphaâ€“beta pruning


## Project 2: PROLOG 
Assignment No. 33:  
Write a program that solves the problem given by the predicate u33(LIN,LOUT), where LIN is the input 
integer list and LOUT is an output list containing all elements of the list 
LIN, in which all even numbers are converted to odd numbers by subtracting one. 

### Tests:
```
 u33_1:- u33([5,-3,4,8,3,1,0,-2], LOUT),write(LOUT). 
 
 [5,-3,3,7,3,1,-1,-3]


 u33_2:- u33([10,3,1,7],LOUT),write(LOUT).

 [9,3,1,7]


 u33([],LOUT),write(LOUT).

 []
```

## Project 3: Decision Trees, ID3 Algorithm
